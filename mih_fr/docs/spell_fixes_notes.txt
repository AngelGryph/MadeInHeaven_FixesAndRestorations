- Warrior HLAs are not spells and cannot be interrupted or trigger wild
  surges.
- Cure spells should not cure drunkenness.
- Slow/Neutralizes Poison should cure drunkenness.
- Remove Fear should have secondary type SPECIFICPROTECIONS, not NON-COMBAT.
- Sunray's undead destroying effect was implemented by it doing ridiculous
  damage instead of an actual disruption effect.  Changed to a disruption
  effect like the Mace of Disruption.
- Stinking Cloud was giving an undocumented +2 bonus on saves, PHB says it
  should not.
- Skull Trap used both the wrong damage dice and wasn't properly capped.
- Horrid Wilting should give water elementals and floral creatures a -2 to
  saves.  (This could only be implemented on EE.)
