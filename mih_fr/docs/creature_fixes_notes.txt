- Elementals:

  Elemental "paws" were all over the place with their enchantment levels,
  with the most glaring bug being that normal elementals struck as +4 while
  the princes only struck as +3.  Several elementals were also not using the
  correct paw, and some greater elementals had a too low HD count.

  This fix systematically changes the enchantment level for lesser elementals
  to +2, normal, greater and elder elementals to +3, and elemental princes to
  +4.
