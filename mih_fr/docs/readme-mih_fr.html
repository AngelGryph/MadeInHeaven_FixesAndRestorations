  <p><strong>Version 5 - <a href="https://github.com/AngelGryph/MadeInHeaven_SpellPack/releases/">Check for the most recent version</a></strong> <br/>
    <strong>Languages: </strong>English <br/>
    <strong>Platforms: </strong>Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux </p>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This is my spell pack for Baldur's Gate 1 and -2.  It introduces several new arcane and divine spells to the game, as well as some new options for paladins.</p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod has been designed to work with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition">BGEE</acronym>, <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 2 Enhanced Edition">BG2EE</acronym> and should be backwards compatible with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 2: Throne of Bhaal">BG2: ToB</acronym>.  The mega-mods <acronym title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</acronym> and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> are also supported.  This mod is not compatible with older versions of the games.
  <p>As a WeiDU mod, this mod should be compatible with all other WeiDU mods.  The core components have no known compatibility issues with any mods.  The tweaks might conflict with other mods that do similar things, like Spell Revisions.  As a spell pack, this mod should be installed fairly early, before any 'tweak' mods.</p>
</div>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Before you install</strong><br/>
  If you have an older version of the MiH Fixes &amp; Restorations, be sure to completely remove it first before trying to install the new version!</p>
  <p><strong>Vanilla BG2 and Baldur's Gate Trilogy</strong><br/>
  Before installing this mod, you must install the latest official patch, and you must also install the Throne of Bhaal Extender (ToBEx) and the G3 Fixpack version 11 or higher.  This mod will not work correctly without those two installed!</p>
  <p><strong>BG1EE and Siege of Dragonspear</strong><br/>
  If you obtained your version of the game through Steam or GoG, you must either run a 'modmerge' or install 'A7-DlcMerger' before installing this mod (or any WeiDU-based mods, really).  If you obtained your game from Beamdog, this is not required.</p>
  <p><strong>BG2EE and Extended Edition Trilogy</strong><br/>
  There are no requirements at this time.  For EET, install this mod after EET has been installed but before the EET installation is finalized.</p>
  <p><strong>Windows</strong><br/>
Made in Heaven: Fixes &amp; Restorations is packaged and installed with WeiDU and is distributed as a zip archive.  Modern versions of Windows have support for zip files built in, just double-click the archive to open it, and extract the contents to your game file.  If you are still using an older version of Windows, you should install WinZip or a similar program to extract the archive.</p>
  <p>Your game folder should then contain a mif_fr folder and setup-mif_fr.exe. To install, double-click setup-mif_fr.exe and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Please run setup-mif_fr.exe in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall, or otherwise change components.  To uninstall the entire mod without questions, run setup-mif_fr.exe --uninstall from a command line in your game directory.</p>
  <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br/>
    Made in Heaven: Fixes &amp; Restorations is packaged and installed with WeiDU and is distributed as a compressed archive.  Extract the contents of the archive and move them to your game folder. Your game folder should then contain a mif_fr folder, setup-mif_fr, and setup-mif_fr.command. To install, simply double-click <strong>setup-mif_fr.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p><strong>Linux</strong><br/>
    Extract the contents of the mod archive to your game installation directory.</p>
  <p>If you haven't already, download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/" title="External link" rel="nofollow external">weidu.org</a> and extract (at least) the weidu executable to a $PATH directory (e.g. /usr/bin).</p>
  <p>To install, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory and
 run <strong>weidu --log setup-mif_fr.debug mif_fr/setup-mif_fr.tp2</strong> from your game installation directory to install or uninstall the mod.</p>
  <p>Note: The readme files of some older mods recommend running tolower on Linux prior to installation.  <b>Don't do this on an Enhanced Edition game, you will break it!</b>  Modern versions of tolower will actually refuse to run in a EE game directory.  At any rate, the contents of MiH: Fixes &amp; Restorations are already all lower case, there is no need for tolower.</p>
  <p><strong>New Game required!</strong><br/>
  After installing this mod you must start a new game.  This mod edits area files and stores, both of which are stored in your save game after you have visited them.  Continuing a saved game after installing this mod will have unexpected and likely undesired results.</p>
</div>
<h2>Component Descriptions</h2>
<div class="section">
  <h3>Core Components</h3>
  <p><strong>Sixth Circle Spell Scrolls in Siege of Dragonspear</strong><br/>
  Five sixths circle spells were actually in Tales of the Sword Coast, although not usable by the player: Invisible Stalker, Globe of Invulnerability, Tenser's Transformation, Flesh to Stone and Death Spell.  Now that Siege of Dragonspear extends the story, it seems only fair to let the player actually have these spells.  This will be most helpful if you have a mod that removes the XP cap so your wizard actually can reach level twelve and have sixth circle spell slot, but even if not they can still use the scrolls.  One copy of each is available at the Sorcerous Sundries (only after SoD starts), and at quartermaster Belegarm in the camp.</p>

<h2>Expert Configuration Options</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>Within the mod folder, there is a file called mif_fr.ini.  This file can be used to fine-tune certain aspects of this mod.  It is meant as an expert option; for normal installation you can leave this file as it is.  If you do edit this file, you must reinstall the mod, or at least the components for which you changed settings.</p>
